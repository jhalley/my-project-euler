Contains my solutions to various Project Euler problems.

I'm doing this partly because I don't want to lose my solutions again the next time my computer dies (which is why this not a complete set). 
This is an ongoing weekend project of mine. Hopefully, I'll answer everything eventually.

Solutions are coded in python. Not necessarily the most optimal solutions, but they all run below 1 min on my laptop.
